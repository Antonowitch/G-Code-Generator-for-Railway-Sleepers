# G-Code-Generator-for-Railway-Sleepers
This Python application provides a simple GUI for generating G-code to mill railway sleepers and rails using a CNC machine. Users can input parameters such as track length, sleeper spacing, overhang, cutting depth, feed rates, and spindle speed. The program supports both X and Y axis milling and exports the generated G-code to a .nc or .txt file.
